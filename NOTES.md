## Initial research
What is the project about?
- visualisation for analysis of carbon emissions

What are some key essentials needed to get it off the ground?
- charting library for data visualisation
- a general purpose way to make requests to an api
- frontend framework to get an app running quickly
- data parsed into a graph
- instructions
- matching designs

Optional considerations
- handling of different data series
- error handling for api failure
- make project accessible online via deployment
- basic navigation with sample pages
- visual flair such as animations without compromising on design

### Design Analysis
Questions to answer:
- How is the layout structured?
- What requirements does the design have?

A brief analysis of the figma project revealed the following:
- a 2-axis bar chart with 2 graphs laid on top of each other
- specific design and set color scheme
- color scheme and fonts seemed to be derived from a design system (active nav element is the same as bar colors)
- basic navigation with logo on the left and a user-profile on the right
- copyrighted font called `TT Hoves` is used
- app icon logo
